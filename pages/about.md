### How do the Breaks work?
The EUR Data Coffee Breaks are ***short, focused, and informal*** presentations around Research Data Management (RDM). Each month is devoted to a different RDM topic, and each topic is presented twice a month. EUR researchers can join either an online or hybrid session that takes place on Thursday or Monday, respectively.  

We start the session with a 10–15-minute presentation, followed by 15 minutes for questions and discussion. These short presentations are, of course, nothing more than starting points, but we are happy to organize in-depth support and training when needed. 

### What topics will be covered?
Most topics are presented by the Research Data Stewards, but we welcome guests to present more specialized topics. Do you have suggestions for a topic or a speaker? Please get in touch by clicking on the envelope.
